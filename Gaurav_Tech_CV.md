# Gaurav Kishore Panwar

## Introduction

##### Greetings, everyone. Firstly, I would like to thank You and the Institute, for giving me this

##### opportunity to be part of the Admissions process.

##### It elates Me, that I have been born and brought up in the historical Capital City of Delhi, which

##### inspires Me, to be great , just like it’s present and former denizens. My parents, are both

##### educationists and have taught Me a lot about both academics and life at large.

##### I have done my schooling from St. Xavier’s School, an institute of fascinating heritage, which

##### has infused me with Discipline, Integrity and Care for others. I was honoured to receive the

##### responsibility of Sports Captain, owing to my excellence in both academics and sports. This

##### helped me inculcate a sense of Team-spirit, Leadership skills and confidence. I also participated

##### and won many competitions filling me with a competitive spirit and an eagerness to learn,

##### while learning a great deal about Myself.

##### I then pursued my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Delhi Technological University

##### (Formerly DCE), another great institute with an enviable legacy. I continued to hone both my

##### curricular and extra-curricular skills, by organizing the C/C++ IDG under CSI to help freshers

##### understand the nuances of Application Development, a highly requisited skill for all Computer

##### Science students. I also helped organize the 2nd DTU Great Run, spreading awareness about the

##### benefits of Healthy living and Community participation.

##### Presently, I am working as a Full-Stack Developer at NIIT-Technologies Limited.

##### I love to hone my Communication skills and boost my Creativity, with leisure reading and

##### writing, especially poems. I also like keep myself Fit, Entertained and Engage with people by

##### Dancing, Listening to music and Playing football.

## Why MBA?

##### I’ve always been fascinated, by how mammoth organizations are managed, financed and grow.

##### And how, even small entrepreneurs with innovative ideas, in what has increasingly become a

##### trend today, grow into behemoth and widely coveted organizations. And frankly, have never

##### quite understood it, as well as I would have liked to.

##### Also, I wish to become a Civil Servant one day and feel that no-one needs a thorough

##### understanding of the art of business and people management, better than a person who has to

##### manage the affairs of a District, State or an entire Nation. What greater economic or

##### demographic entity can there be?

##### So, an MBA for Me, is an opportunity to learn and understand the nuances of the business

##### arena at large, and implementing it for the betterment of my nation.


## Why IIM-R?

##### Yours is an institute, part of an enduring legacy of Business Schools providing a thorough

##### understanding of management principles and techniques to students from all over the nation.

##### And it is my firm belief, that with a widely appreciated industry wide acceptance and

##### recognition, it opens up a plethora of opportunities for it’s students.
