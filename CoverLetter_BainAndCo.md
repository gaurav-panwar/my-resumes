# Subject: Application for the post of Analyst

## Respected Madam,

I am currently pursuing my B.Tech.(Computer Engineering, Final year) from Delhi Technological
University. I wish to join Bain and Company as an Analyst. I have an avid interest in Consultancy Services due
to my ardent nature of helping other people. Through the company I wish to provide your clients with
innovative ideas based on exhaustive research and help them grow in their respective fields and in the
process grow myself as well, professionally and individually. I wish to learn about Consultancy from the # 1
Consultancy firm in the world and also strive and stretch myself to make my contributions help Bain & Co.
gain and retain valuable clients.

As an engineer I am constantly required to innovate and look at things analytically to try and solve the real
life problems people and at large the human society faces. Also as a coding enthusiast, I am constantly
solving problems to get solutions that are both easily achievable and are accurate to the core. As the _Sports
Captain_ at school, I gained experience in working with and coordinating with teams and people to help them
achieve their required goals leading up to achieve the team’s ultimate goal. I’ve also helped a budding book
enthusiast and friend Pankaj Gambhir of Reader’s Destination Library in the smart maintenance of the library
by developing a system that helps compile and analyse all the data to manage the library and help grow the
start-up. This has given me immense confidence and helped boost my skills as a system analyst. I actively
participated and won many debates and academic contests at the school level. This has enhanced my ability
to fluently express my own ideas and understand other’s. While in college, I managed the C/C++ Interest
Development Group under CSI. There I was required to initiate the newcomers into the languages and help
them learn and grow with the language. This enabled me to understand and give solutions to their problems
to enhance their future careers. I believe that my leadership skills, analytical ability and good communication
skills have given me the requisite skills and ability to contribute to the growth and success of your firm.

”To be in consulting is to be constantly intellectually simulated.” - Ms. Shikha, BCC. Therefore, I look forward
to the opportunity of being interviewed in order to share more about my experience and skills that I could
bring to your company. Also I would like to know what you think about me and learn and achieve goals both
for the company and myself. Thank you for your time and consideration.
